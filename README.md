# Requirements to run

## Install Julia
```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh
```

# How to run
Go to src folder
```bash
cd src
```

## Install dependencies
Inside the src/ folder enter the Julia REP, install the dependencies and run the program with the following command
```bash
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate(); include("app.jl")'
```
This will open a local server you can access in your browser at http://localhost:8000. The port may be different, check the output of the command.

## If you have problems with the PlotlyJS package
Enter the Julia REPL
```bash
julia --project=.
```

Then enter the package manager
```julia
] 
```
and run the following command
```julia
build PlotlyJS
```

## Run the program
```bash
include("app.jl")
```

## The program
Our program is a UI web-based application that allows you to solve the delivery scheduling problem using different algorithms. The user can select the algorithm to use, the problem instance to solve and the parameters of the algorithm. The program will then show the evolution of the solution and the final solution.

# About the project

## Metaheuristics for Optimization/Decision Problems

An optimization problem is characterized by the existence of a (typically large) set of possible solutions, comparable to each other, of which one or more are considered (globally) optimal solutions. 
Depending on the specific problem, an **evaluation function** allows you to establish this comparison between solutions. In many of these problems, it is virtually impossible to find the optimal solution or to ensure that the solution found is optimal, and, as such, the **goal is to try to find a locally optimal** solution that maximizes/minimizes a given evaluation function to the extent possible. 

In this work, the aim is to implement a system to solve an optimization problem, using different algorithms or meta-heuristics, such as 
- hill-climbing
- simulated annealing
- tabu search
- genetic algorithms
You may include other algorithms or variations of these.

Multiple instances of the chosen problem must be solved, and the **results obtained by each algorithm must be compared**. 
Different parameterizations of the algorithms should be tested and compared, in terms of the **average quality of the solution** obtained and the **average time spent** to obtain the solutions. 
All problems should have **different sizes/difficulties** to solve. 

The application to be developed should have an appropriate visualization in text or graphic mode, to **show the evolution of the quality of the solution** obtained along the way and the final (i.e. local optimal) solution, and to **interact with the user**. 

You should **allow the selection and parameterization of the algorithms** and the selection of the instance of the problem to be solved.

## Problem to be solved: Delivery Scheduling
Delivery scenario where packages of three types must be transported from a starting point (0, 0) to various delivery locations. Each package type incurs different costs and penalties during transportation.

### Packages types
1. Fragile packages: Have a chance of damage during transportation.
2. Normal packages: No risk of damage during transportation.
3. Urgent packages: Incur a penalty for delivery outside the expected time.


### Objective
Design an algorithm to optimize the delivery order of packages, considering the following criteria

1. Minimize Fragile Damage
2. Minimize Travel Costs
3. Adhere to Urgent Delivery Constraints:

### Constraints
1. You only have one vehicle available.
2. The delivery locations are speciÔ¨Åed by their coordinates.
3. Routes between all delivery coordinates are available.
4. The driver drives at 60km per hour and takes 0 seconds to deliver the goods.
5. The cost per km is C=0.3.

### Objective Function
Minimize the total cost, considering fragile damage, travel costs, and urgent delivery
penalties.

### Input
Package information, including type (fragile, normal, urgent) and coordinates of
delivery locations.

### Output
Optimized delivery order that minimizes the total cost.

### Evaluation criteria
- Total cost: Your algorithm should provide the deliveries at the lowest cost possible.
- Reputation: Your algorithm should ensure deliveries on time and minimize package
breaks to keep the reputation of the delivery company intact.
