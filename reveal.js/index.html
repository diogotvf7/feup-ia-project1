                    <p>
                        Consider a delivery scenario where packages of three types - fragile, normal, and
                        urgent - must be transported from a starting point at coordinates (0, 0) to various
                        delivery locations. Each package type incurs different costs and penalties during
                        transportation.

                        Design an algorithm to optimize the delivery order of packages, considering the
                        following criteria:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Minimize Fragile Damage</li>

                    <p>
                        Hill Climbing is a heuristic search used for mathematical optimization problems. 
                        It is an iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem, 
                        then attempts to find a better solution by incrementally changing a single element of the solution. 
                        If the change produces a better solution, an incremental change is made to the new solution, 
                        repeating until no further improvements can be found.

                    <p>
                        Simulated annealing is a probabilistic technique used for finding an approximate solution to an optimization problem. 
                        It is a probabilistic algorithm that relies on randomization to escape local optima. 
                        The algorithm is based on the analogy of the physical process of annealing, 
                        a technique used to reduce defects in materials.

                    <p>
                        Tabu search is a metaheuristic search method employing local search methods used for mathematical optimization. 
                        Local search methods are used to move from one solution to a neighboring solution. 
                        The algorithm uses a memory structure to store solutions that have been visited, 
                        and these are used to avoid revisiting the same solution.

                    <p>
                        Genetic algorithms are a class of optimization algorithms which are based on the principles of natural selection. 
                        They are used to find approximate solutions to optimization and search problems. 
                        The algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.

                    <p>
                        Julia is a high-level programming language for technical computing. 
                        It's syntax is similar to Python making it easy to learn. 
                        It is also know for its high-performance 
                        <sup><a href="https://julialang.org/benchmarks/">(i)</a></sup>
                        and for the vast ammount of compatible libraries.
                        Another strong aspect about Julia lies in its accessible support for parallelism, 
                        which significantly enhances its efficiency, especially for optimization 
                        problems such as the one we are currently tackling.
