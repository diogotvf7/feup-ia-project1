## Checkpoint 

## 4.  Implementation work already carried out (programming language, development environment, data structures, among others).

We choose to use Julia as the programming language for this project. Julia is a high-level and high-performance programming language for technical computing. It is a language that is easy to learn and has a syntax that is similar to Python. It is also a language that is very efficient and has a lot of libraries that can be used for optimization problems. His main advantage is about the parallelism under the hood, which makes it very efficient for optimization problems like the one we are trying to solve.

All the code will be developed in Julia files an...
